00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.000
There are three methods clinical trials can be run.  

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:21.000 
1) Placebo. In clinical trials that compare a new medicine or treatment with another that already exists.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:36.900
Researchers will assign some participants to receive the new medicine that has its treatment value, and others will receive an inactive product called a placebo.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The purpose of a placebo is to compare whether the effects of the treatment differ between the placebo and treatment groups.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:00.900
2) Randomization. It is the process by which treatments are assigned to two different groups.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.500
This is done to avoid any bias in intentionally assigning specific participants to get one treatment or another. 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.400
Participants are randomly assigned to treatment groups without any influence from the research team. 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.900
The effects of each treatment are compared at specific points during a trial. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.900
If one treatment is found to be more beneficial, the trial is stopped so that the participants receive the more beneficial treatment. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.100
If the other treatment is found to be more beneficial, the participants undergo the same process to ensure all participants receive the appropriate treatment. 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:59.000
3) Blinded studies. There are two kinds of blinded studies: single-blind and double-blind.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:13.900
In single-blind studies, when a pharmacist gives participants medication, participants are not told what they are given, while the research team knows. 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:33.000
In a double-blind study, neither the participants nor the research team are told what they are given; only the pharmacist knows. 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.000
In case of a medical emergency, the pharmacist will let the research team know which treatment participants are receiving so that they can adjust the treatment.
