00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.000
Who can participate in clinical trials?

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.000
Both people who are healthy and those with illnesses (patients) can participate in clinical trials.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.000
I will explain 1) why people volunteer to participate in clinical trials,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.500
2) what people who participate in clinical trials should expect, and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.000
and 3) what the inclusion and exclusion criteria are for participating in clinical trials.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.900
Why are healthy people encouraged to participate in clinical trials?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Results from tests on healthy volunteers, such as a blood test or imaging device like an MRI,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:01:15.000
help define the baseline against which patient groups are compared to help identify a disease.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:16.000
Researchers learn about the disease process by comparing the patient group to the healthy volunteers.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:28.000
Participantsâ€™ characteristics in healthy groups are often matched to their patient groups on factors such as age, gender, or family history.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.000
The only difference between the healthy volunteer and patient is that the patient has an illness, whereas the healthy volunteer does not.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Would patient volunteers benefit from participating in a clinical trial?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.000
Research with a patient volunteer helps develop new knowledge

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:50.000
to better understand, diagnose, or treat that disease or condition.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:02:05.000
You may benefit by receiving tested medicine or treatment before it is made available to the general public,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.000
but its effect depends on the stage of knowledge about the disease or condition.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
What may you expect from participating in a clinical trial? What do you need to know?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Your participation may be time consuming.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.000
Some trials are short, while others require more time and commitment.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
There are some points at which you may not feel comfortable.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.000
There are also some risks to participating in a clinical trial.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Even if you are a healthy volunteer, there is an informed consent process that ensures that you fully understand the clinical trial process and any risks.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.000
Not everyone who is a patient participant will receive the treatment.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.000
It is likely that the patient study group will be split up into two treatment groups,

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:12.000
with one group receiving the treatment and the other receiving a placebo treatment.

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:16.000
There is a very low chance that there is any benefit to receiving the placebo.

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:27.500
What are the criteria/qualifications for participation in a clinical trial look like?

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:37.500
Researchers follow clinical trials guidelines when deciding who can participate in a study.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Should you not meet the requirements listed in the inclusion/exclusion criteria, you will not be able to participate in the study.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:04:58.000
These criteria are based on factors such as age, gender, the type and severity of a disease,

00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:06.000
treatment history, and other medical conditions.

00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:12.000
You must provide this information to the research team before joining a clinical trial.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are not used to reject people personally.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Instead, the criteria are used to identify appropriate participants and keep them safe,

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.000
and to help ensure that researchers can find new information they need.
