00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Your safety is protected in a clinical trial in three ways.

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:16.000
1) Ethical guidelines. The goal of clinical research is to increase understanding of human biology

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:20.500
and discover treatments that improve human health.

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:26.000
To determine if a new drug is safe or effective, it is tested on people who are recruited as participants in clinical trials. 

00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:31.000
There are risks associated with this research. 

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:42.000
The purpose of ethical guidelines is both to protect patients and healthy volunteers, 

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.000
and to preserve the integrity of the science.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.000
2) Institutional Review Board (IRB).

00:01:01:100 → 00:01:08:000
Once a clinical trial is designed and ready for review, 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.500
Most, but not all, clinical trials in the United States are approved and monitored by an IRB.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
An IRB is an independent committee that consists of 

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:28.000
physicians, statisticians, other scientists, and members of the community

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:44.000
who review the study design to ensure that the risks are minimal when compared with potential benefits.

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:51.000
You should ask the research coordinator whether the research you are considering participating in 

00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:54.000
was reviewed and approved by an IRB.

00:01:54.001 --> 00:02:05.000
If the research has been approved by the IRB, 

00:01:54.001 --> 00:02:05.000
it has strong ethical integrity and the rights of participants are protected. 

00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:19.000
3) Informed consent.

00:02:20.001 --> 00:02:31.000
Informed consent is the process of learning the key facts about a clinical trial before deciding whether to participate. 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:39.500
The research team provides an informed consent document, which includes such details about

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:59.000
study's purpose, its duration, required procedures, risks and benefits, and who to contact. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The process of providing information to participants continues throughout the study. 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.000
If you decide to enroll in the trial, you will need to sign the informed consent document. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000
You are free to withdraw from the study at any time.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
